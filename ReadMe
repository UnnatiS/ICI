In the Java programming language, the proposed approach is implemented. The tests were carried out on a 12.00 GB RAM Intel (R) Core (TM) i5 CPU. 
The project requires : 
1.Netbans (version 8.1) to be available - https://netbeans.org/community/releases/81/ or https://netbeans.org/images_www/v6/download/community/8.2 
2. WordNetDictionary to be available(version 3.1) - https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version/
3. Stanford parser to be available (version 4) - https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download
4. protege tool to be available (version 4.3)- https://protege.stanford.edu/download/protege/4.3/installanywhere/Web_Installers/ 
The project requires the following Jar files:
collections15-4.01.jar
com.ibm.icu_3.4.4.1.jar
commons-lang-2.5.jar
edu.mit.jwi_2.4.0.jar
Jama-1.0.2.jar
kd.jar
opennlp-tools-1.6.0.jar 
org.apache.commons.io.jar
org.springframework.beans.jar
ws4j-1.0.1.jar
To start the program in Netbeans, you'll need to set the classpath, path for Wordnet and intermideiate files. Interfaces are also given (Interface ICI.zip).
Input file: 
Input_Requirements.txt: 
Format: Natural Language Requirements (extract requirements from the document as single requirement per line - input file format is restricted to text file only as of now)
This file contains all natural language requirements for a specific domain.This file is an input to the preprocessing module.
Intermediate Outcome: 
outTfIdfVec.txt; wup.txt; tfidfsim.txt; lsi.txt; agloOutClustering.txt; NFRs_ClusteringResutls.txt (Format: Natural Language Requirement; Cluster Number - This file includes the clustering results of NFRs. The first column is a requirement, and the second column is a group number based on an agglomerative clustering algorithm and semantic similarity.)  
Quality_OntologyISO9126.owl:
Format: Web Ontology Language 
This file is the partial quality ontology based on the ISO / IEC 9126 quality standard and developed by the Protege tool.
Intra-ConflictsResults.txt : 
Format : Requirements ; Conflict Number 
This file provides partial intra-conflict outcomes identified from Input Requirements.txt. 
Here, the first column is a requirement and the second column is a number-the requirements conflict with which one is listed.
For example, 
The recycled parts shall be returned to the user within 10 seconds.;The search results shall be returned in under 15 seconds.; 1
intranfr.owl
Format: Web Ontology Language 
Ontological representation of Intra-conflciting NFRs
